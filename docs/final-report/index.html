<h1 align="middle">Abstract</h1>
    <p>
        Realistic fluid simulations is an ever expanding and improving field in computer graphics. Several previous groups have attempted to 
        tackle this topic and ended up creating water simulations that are physically accurate, but look more akin to jello. We are interested 
        in creating a more realistic fluid simulation by also implementing water-air interactions like bubbles, spray, and foam. To do so, we implemented 
        Position Based Fluids by Macklin and Müller for the underlying fluid simulation and Unified Spray, Foam and Bubbles for Particle-Based Fluids 
        by Ihmsen et al. to simulate water-air interactions. To convert our fluid and water-air particles into a mesh we implemented the marching cubes 
        algorithm using isotropic kernels. Finally we rendered the mesh using Blender's “Cycles” path tracing engine.

    <h2 align="middle">Position-Based Fluid Simulation</h2>
    <p>
        To implement our project, we started with a particle based water simulation.
        Our code has a <code>Fluid</code> struct, which handles all of the <code>Particle</code> structs.
        Each <code>Particle</code> struct has a list of their neighbors along with the current and previous position and velocity.
        We use Euler's method along with incompressibility, collision, viscosity and vorticity constraints to update our <code>Particle</code> positions at each time step.
        <!--
        To accelerate the simulation, we implemented and a hashtable to store a spatial map of <code>Particles</code>.
        The spatial map of <code>Particles</code> divides space into cubes that are \(h\) (where \(h\) is a user-defined parameter) wide.
        Each particle is assigned to a cube, so when we search for a particle's neighbors, which are all the particles within \(h\) distance away, we only search the cube the particle is in and its immediate neighbors. 
        -->
    </p>
    <!--We implemented the algorithm slightly differently from the paper. We had a temporary velocity that updated at the very end rather than updating velocity then applying
    vort and visc then updating position. idk why we did it that way-->
    
    <h3>Incompressibility</h3>
    <p>
        The incompressibility constraint applies a small change in position \(\Delta \textbf{p}_i\) to keep the volume of the fluid constant.
        We estimate the density of each particle as \(\rho_i = \sum_j m_j W_{poly6} (\textbf{p}_i-\textbf{p}_j, \ h)\), where
        \(W_{poly6} (\|\pmb{r}\|, h) = \begin{cases} (h^2 - \|\pmb{r}\|^2)^3 & 0 \leq \|\pmb{r}\| \leq h \\ 0 & otherwise, \end{cases}\).

        <br>
        
        We use the particle density \(\rho_i\) and fluid's rest density \(\rho_0\) to calculate a density constraint \(C_i\) 
        \[C_i =\frac{\rho_i}{\rho_0}-1\]

        After doing some algebraic manipulation, we derived an equivalent expression which was easier to implement in code to what is presented in the paper for calculating the gradient of the constraint function \(\nabla_{\textbf{p}_k}C_i\)
        \[\nabla_{\textbf{p}_k}C_i = \frac{1}{\rho_0} \left(\left\|\sum_j\nabla W_{spiky}(\textbf{p}_i-\textbf{p}_j, h)\right\|^2 +\sum_j\|\nabla W_{spiky} (\textbf{p}_i-\textbf{p}_j, h)\|^2 \right)\]
        
        where
        \(\nabla W_{spiky}(\textbf{r},h) = -\textbf{r} \frac{45}{\pi h^6 \|\pmb{r}\|}(h- \|\pmb{r}\|)^2\).

        \(\nabla_{\textbf{p}_k}C_i\) is used to calculate a scaling factor \(\lambda_i\) with \(\epsilon\) as a relaxation parameter.<br>
        \[\lambda_i = -\frac{C_i(\textbf{p}_1, \ldots ,\textbf{p}_n)} {\sum_k|\nabla_{\textbf{p}_k}C_i|^2+\epsilon}\]

        We also add an artifical pressure with a fixed vector \(\Delta \textbf{q}\), and small constants \(k\) and \(n\). 
        \[s_{corr} = -k\left(\frac{W_{poly6}(\textbf{p}_i-\textbf{p}_j,h)}{W_{poly6}(\Delta\textbf{q},h)}\right)^n\]

        To enforce incompressibility, we calculate \(\Delta \textbf{p}_i\) .
        \[\Delta\textbf{p}_i=\frac{1}{\rho_0}\sum_{j}(\lambda_i + \lambda_j + s_{corr})\nabla W_{spiky} (\textbf{p}_i-\textbf{p}_j, h)\]
    </p>
    
    <h3>Collision Detection and Response</h3>
    <p>
        Since the paper did not specify how to handle collisions, and the Project 4 method of collision response seemed to not preserve energy well enough, we implemented
        <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.302.1856&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this paper</a>
        for collision response.
        Each plane has a point and a normal vector which defines the side that the particle should always be on.
        To detect collision we check if the vector from the wall to the particle is in the opposite direction of the wall's normal vector.
        If collision is detected, we calculate where the particle collides with the wall and update the particle's \(\Delta \textbf{p}_i\) to move the particle to that point. We then reflect the particle's velocity along the wall's normal.
        \[\textbf{v}_i^{temp} = \textbf{v}_i^{temp} - \left(1 + c_R \frac{d}{\Delta t \|\textbf{v}_i^{temp}\|}\right)(\textbf{v}_i^{temp} \cdot  \textbf{n})\textbf{n}\]
        If we don't detect a collision, we set \(\textbf{v}_i^{temp} = \left(\textbf{x}_i^{*}+\Delta\textbf{p} - \textbf{x}_i^{prev}\right)/\Delta t\)
    </p>
    
    <h3>Viscosity</h3>
    <p>
        Viscosity is a fluid's tendency to resist a change in flow. To implement viscosity we add an artificial viscosity calculation with a small constant \(c\) to \(\textbf{v}_i^{temp}\).
        \[\textbf{v}_i^{temp} = \textbf{v}_i^{temp} + c\sum_j\textbf{v}_{ij} W_{poly6} (\textbf{p}_i-\textbf{p}_j,h)\]
    </p>
    
    <h3>Vorticity</h3>
    <p>
        Vorticity is the tendency of a fluid to rotate as it moves along its path. To implement vorticity we calculate a vorticity estimator
        \(\omega_i = \nabla \times \textbf{v} = \sum_j(\textbf{v}_{j} - \textbf{v}_{i}) \times \nabla_{\textbf{p}_j} W_{spiky} (\textbf{p}_i-\textbf{p}_j,h)\).
        We then calculate and apply a corrective velocity to our particle.
        
        \[\textbf{v}_i^{temp} = \textbf{v}_i^{temp} + \varepsilon \frac{\nabla \|\pmb{\omega}\|_i}{\| \nabla \|\pmb{\omega}\|_i \|} \times \pmb{\omega}_i \Delta t \]
        where \(\varepsilon\) is a separate vorticity parameter (not to be confused with the relaxation parameter \(\epsilon\) used in enforcing incompressibility).

        In order to calculate \(\nabla \|\pmb{\omega}\|_i\), we chose to approximate it as \( \sum_j \left(\frac{\left \|\pmb{\omega}_j\right \|-\left \|\pmb{\omega}_i\right \|}{\textbf{p}_j - \textbf{p}_i} \right) \).

<h2 align="middle">Adding Spray, Foam, and Bubbles</h2>
<p>
    Our main goal with this project was adding diffuse particles to fluid simulations, and our code architecture closely mirrors our fluid simulation architecture.
    <code>ParentFluid</code> is a struct which owns all the <code>DiffuseParticle</code> structs in the scene.
    <code>ParentFluid</code> also has a pointer to the <code>Fluid</code> for the scene, which allows it to access the positions and velocities of all the <code>Particle</code> structs in the scene.
    We implemented <a href="https://cg.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publications/2012_CGI_sprayFoamBubbles.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this paper</a> to advect and generate diffuse particles.
</p>

<h3>Generation</h3>
<p>
    To determine the number of diffuse particles \(n_d\) that fluid particle \(i\) generates, we calculate \(I_k\), \(I_{ta}\), and \(I_{wc}\), which indicate the potential to generate diffuse particles due to kinetic energy, trapped air, and wave crests, respectively.
    To ensure that all the potentials are between 0 and 1, we use a clamping function \(\Phi\) which is defined as
    \[\Phi(I, \tau^{\text{min}}, \tau^{\text{max}}) = \frac{\min(I, \tau^{\max}) - \min(I, \tau^{\min})}{\tau^{\max} - \tau^{\min}}\]
    where \(\tau^{\min}, \tau^{\max}\) are user-defined parameters.
</p>

<p>
    The potentials are calculated by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        \(I_k = \Phi (E_{k, i}, \tau_k^{\text{min}}, \tau_k^{\text{max}})\), where \(E_{k, i} = \frac{1}{2} m_i \|\pmb{v}_i\|^2\) is the kinetic energy of particle \(i\).
    </li>
    <li>
        \(I_{ta} = \Phi (v_i^{\text{diff}}, \tau_{ta}^{\text{min}}, \tau_{ta}^{\text{max}})\), where \(v_i^{\text{diff}} = \sum_j \|\pmb{v}_{ij}\| (1 - \pmb{\hat{v}}_{ij} \cdot \pmb{\hat{x}}_{ij}) W (\pmb{x}_{ij}, h)\), with \(\pmb{v}_{ij} = \pmb{v}_i - \pmb{v}_j\), \(\pmb{x}_{ij} = \pmb{x}_i - \pmb{x}_j\), the hat notation denoting normalization, and 
        \[W (\pmb{x}_{ij}, h) = \begin{cases} 1 - \|\pmb{x}_{ij}\| / h & \|\pmb{x}_{ij}\| \leq h \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\]
        This assumes that the amount of trapped air is larger if fluid particles move towards each other.
    </li>
    <li>
        \(I_{wc} = \Phi (\tilde{\kappa}_i \cdot \delta_i^{vn}, \tau_{wc}^{\text{min}}, \tau_{wc}^{\text{max}})\), where \(\tilde{\kappa}_i = \sum\limits_{\{ j : \pmb{\hat{x}}_{ji} \cdot \pmb{\hat{n}}_i < 0 \}} (1 - \pmb{\hat{n}}_i \cdot \pmb{\hat{n}}_j) W(\pmb{x}_{ij}, h)\) approximates the curvature and considers only convex regions, and \(\delta_i^{vn} = \begin{cases} 0 & \pmb{\hat{v}}_i \cdot \pmb{\hat{n}}_i < 0.6 \\ 1 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\) checks if the fluid particle moves in the normal direction, to prevent situations such as the edges of a cube being considered as wave crests.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
    After calculating the potentials,
    \[n_d = I_k (k_{ta} I_{ta} + k_{wc} I_{wc}) \Delta t\]
    gives us the number of diffuse particles that fluid particle \(i\) generates.
    To create the generated diffuse particles, we need two vectors \(\pmb{e}_1'\) and \(\pmb{e}_2'\) which are orthogonal to \(\pmb{v}_i\).
    Because the paper did not specify what \(\pmb{e}_1'\) and \(\pmb{e}_2'\) to use, we decided to use Gram-Schmidt to get \(\pmb{e}_1'\) by orthogonalizing one of the standard unit basis vectors with \(\pmb{v}_i\), and then taking \(\pmb{e}_2' = \pmb{e}_1' \times \pmb{v}_i\).
    We then consider a cylinder with radius equal to the radius of the fluid particle (which we always take to be \(1/10\)), height \(\| \Delta t \pmb{v}_i \|\), and base spanned by \(\pmb{e}_1'\) and \(\pmb{e}_2'\).
    We then place diffuse particles uniformly in that cylinder offset by the fluid particle's position, and we initialize the velocity of the diffuse particle to be \(r \cos \theta \pmb{e}_i' + r \sin \theta \pmb{e}_2' + \pmb{v}_i\), where \(r, \theta\) are the typical cylindrical coordinates.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, for each generated diffuse particle, we classify it as spray if it has less than 6 fluid particle neighbors, bubbles if it has more than 20 fluid particle neighbors, and foam otherwise.
    If it is foam, we initialize its time to live to be \(n_d\), to model the effect of larger foam clusters being more stable than smaller ones.
</p>

<h3>Advection</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Spray:</b>
        The motion of spray particles is not affected by water, so the position and velocity update is just performed using Euler's method with any external forces present (in our simulations, we only use gravity).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Foam:</b>
        To model a foam particle being transported by the water, we compute the averaged local fluid velocity at the particle's position \(\pmb{x}_d\) as
        \[\pmb{\tilde{v}} (\pmb{x}_d, t + \Delta t) = \frac{\sum_f \frac{\pmb{x}_f (t + \Delta t) - \pmb{x}_f (t)}{\Delta t} \cdot K (\pmb{x}_d -  \pmb{x}_f (t), h)}{ \sum_f K (\pmb{x}_d -  \pmb{x}_f (t), h)}\]
        where \(K = \sigma \begin{cases} 1 - 1.5 q^2 + 0.75 q^3 & q \leq 1 \\ 0.25 (2 - q)^3 & 1 < q \leq 2 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \) is the cubic spline kernel
        with \(q = \|\pmb{x}\| / h\) and \(\sigma = \frac{1}{\pi h^3}\).
        <br>
        Because \(\pmb{\tilde{v}} (\pmb{x}_d, t + \Delta t)\) is not defined if there are no fluid neighbors, and the paper does not specify how to handle this case, we decided to erase the particle if this ever happens.
        Then we update the foam particle's position using the averaged local fluid velocity, but we do not update its velocity in order to constrain it to the fluid surface.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Bubbles:</b>
        To model buoyancy acting on bubble particles, we update the velocity as
        \[\pmb{v} (t + \Delta t) = \pmb{v}(t) + \Delta t \left( -k_b \pmb{g} + k_d \frac{\pmb{\tilde{v}} (\pmb{x}_d, t + \Delta t) - \pmb{v} (t) }{ \Delta t}  \right)\]
        where \(k_b\) and \(k_d\) are parameters which control buoyancy and drag (in our simulations, we use 0.5 for both).
        Then we update the position using Euler's method.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 align="middle">Mesh Generation</h2>

<h3>Marching Cubes</h3>
<p>
    For mesh generation we implemented the marching cubes algorithm from the
    <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/meshpapers/LorensenCline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marching cubes paper</a>.
    We subdivided the entire object space into a multitude of smaller marching cubes.
    Then for each marching cube, we take its eight corner points, calculate their isovalues with the iso function and decide if it should render a triangle at an edge connecting to that vertex based on the vertex's isovalues.
    Then we generate a <code>.obj</code> mesh file containing a list of 3D triangle positions and 3D triangle normal values.
    For our implementation, we also used a subset of code from
    <a href="http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Polygonize website</a>
    that provided the list of all 256 different possible triangles we can render, provided a way to generate an index into the triangle list given a passed in cube, and determined the 3D positions of the triangles.
</p>
<p>
    As part of the mesh generation, we needed to compute the isovalue for each of the voxels (corners of each unit marching cube).
    Here, we decided to use the density calculation, similar to the one described in fluid-particle generation, to be the isofunction.
    The isovalue of each voxel is computed by running the isofunction on all the particles within a specific search radius and summing up all the corresponding density. 
</p>
<div align="middle">
    <img src="images/marching.png"/>
    <figcaption align="middle">Unique corner configurations and their corresponding triangles</figcaption>
</div>
<p>
    To make the animation look more visually pleasing, we computed the normals for each triangle and cube vertex, or else the animation would look noticeably triangulated. 
    And to calculate the normals for each cube vertex, the way we decided to calculate the normal vector of the 3 different planes that each vertex is linked to by computing the vector that goes through the vertex and its diagonal vertex counterpart and making that the normal vector.
    And for the triangle normals we modified the code subset that we used to calculate the triangle positions to calculate the triangle normals, with the cube vertex normals we previously calculated as the input.

<h3>Converting to .obj Files</h3>
<p>
    After running the marching cube algorithm, we are able to generate a list of triangle meshes that represent the surface at each frame.
    In order to input our meshes into our rendering software, we need to turn triangle meshes into a <code>.obj</code> file.
    In order to do this, we need to write code that will write our triangle vertices, normals, and face definitions into a <code>.obj</code> file.
    The code is relatively straightforward: we write the vertices, normal, and face definition line by line into a file.
</p>
<h2 align="middle">Rendering in Blender</h2>
<p>
    To import our meshes into blender, we used a third party addon called Stop Motion OBJ to import our OBJ files 
    as a mesh sequence. To make the particle mesh look like water we used a glass BSDF with the same index of 
    refraction as water. To visualize our diffuse particles, we imported them as a .PLY 
    file using the same third party addon. This imported them as points, which we converted to a volume then a mesh.

<h1 align="middle">Problems Encountered</h1>
<h2 align="middle">Tuning Parameters</h2>
<p>
    We wanted to simulate the fluid with a large number of particles to improve the accuracy of the simulation.
    In order to achieve this high density, we tried to pack a large number of particles in a small box.
    However, when we tried generating a small box we were having issues with the particles getting launched upwards.
    We decided to resolve this problem by using a fixed particle density with a larger box and then scaling down the positions of each particle after simulating.
    By doing this, we are did not experience the blowing-up problem while making the particles denser in our cube.

<h2 align="middle">Speeding up Marching Cubes</h2>
<!-- Re-word to talk baout using the same hash table as particle-sim -->
<h3>Implementing a hashtable for particle neighborhood searching</h3>
<p>
    To run the marching cubes algorithm, we need to find all the particles within a certain distance from each voxel.
    To do this efficiently, we use the same hashmap as used in the fluid simulation.
</p>

<h3>Storing previously calculated isovalues</h3>
<p>
    To further speed up the program, we store previously calculated isovalues in a map.
    Since up to 8 cubes can share a single vertex, storing these results allows us to avoid redundant calculations.
    However, to avoid running out of memory, we throw away results that will no longer be needed. 
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Using <code>.ply</code> Files to Render Diffuse Particles</h2>
<p>
    Even though we tried to speed up our marching cubes algorithm as much as possible, it was still too slow to generate a mesh fine enough for diffuse particles.
    We tried using OpenVDB to convert the particles to a mesh, but when that did not work, we decided to output the particle positions with <code>.ply</code> files and use Blender's built-in functionality to generate meshes from points.
</p>

<h1 align="middle">Results</h1>

<h1 align="middle">Lessons Learned</h1>
<p>
    The lesson we learned was that tuning parameters is a very important and time consuming process that directly determines the quality of the final output no matter how good the code is.
    The method we used for tuning parameters for the marching cubes algorithm was trial and error, and for tuning the particle physics simulation parameters, we wrote a Jupyter Notebook script that automated the tuning process, along with plotting the results in Matplotlib to visually verify the quality of the output based on our parameters.
    Both methods of parameter tuning still took longer than we expected.
