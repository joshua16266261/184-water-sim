<h1 align="middle">Project Proposal</h2>

<br><br>

<h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
<p>We want to realistically simulate water in a way that shows how it moves and interacts within a set environment. We also want the water to have spray, foam, and bubbles that would be created when air gets mixed in with the water.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
<p>Many water simulations do not include the interactions with air, which results in water that does not quite resemble what real-life splashing water would look like. We want to tackle the problem of making water simulation more realistic by including these water-air interactions. A more realistic simulation allows for scenes such as the ocean or waterfall that look more realistic.</p>
<p>This is challenging because simulating water-air interaction introduces more variables/equations to consider and an extra layer of complexity. We are going to solve this problem by making assumptions that approximate the physical interactions between water and air without needing to simulate air.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
<p>To measure the accuracy and quality of our result, we will qualitatively compare our final simulation results against benchmark simulations (without water-air interaction) along with reference images/videos of real water-air interactions.</p>

<p>We plan to deliver multiple videos of realistic water simulations with water-air simulations.</p>
<p>We hope to deliver realistic water-air simulations that interact with moving physical objects.</p>
